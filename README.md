# tree-exploration
- this code was written in java for the purpose of a project in the Ai course - 

giving any 2D array of a maze with the following attributes
Free space: 1
Obstacle: -1
Goal: 2
Initial position: 0

the code must give the path to the goal using BFS and DFS algorithms,
you can move in all directions including diagonal moves,
each diagonal move cost = squared root of 2,
and each horizontal or vertical move cost = 1,
